							<h2>ABOUT</h2>
							<p>Welcome to South Australian Freedivers (SAF)! Our club was formed in 2014 and continues to grow, welcoming and mentoring new members. SAF is a formally incorporated sporting club in South Australia and the state's Affiliated Club of the Australian Freediving Association.
                We host multiple pool training sessions each week, the occasional ocean fun dive, and an annual pool competition (the South Australian Freedive Pool Challenge) along with other mini competitions, social events, and workshops from visiting elite divers.
                We welcome divers of all levels, from complete beginner to experienced, and seek to encourage and develop this sport which we love.
                Many of our club members have competed at both national and international levels, but you're welcome to train with us whether you’re interested in competition, fitness, spearfishing, underwater photography, breath-hold for surf safety, or just fun diving.
                Come along to train in a safe environment, meet other enthusiasts, find buddies to dive with, and you could pick up some tips from national and world champions along the way!
                <br><br>
                Our club committee usually has a mix of competitive divers, administrators and freediving judges, as well as recreational and social divers. The 2019-2020 committee is made up of:
                <br>
                <strong>President:</strong> Jody Fisher <br>
                <strong>Secretary:</strong> Craig de Vos <br>
                <strong>Treasurer:</strong> Cath Christie <br>
                <strong>Safety Officer:</strong> Natasha Darke <br>
                <strong>AFA Liaison:</strong> Lisa Borg <br>
              </p>

            <h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>
            <p>To join us, you need to join the Australian Freediving Association (AFA) as a SA Freedivers member ($90/year in total, which includes a $20 SAF club member fee). The fees are discounted by 50% mid-way through the membership season, and the discount has been brought forward due to COVID.
              This membership provides the club and its individuals insurance (which we need to have access to pools) and allows the club to reinvest in its activities (e.g. to offset costs of running competitions or workshops).
              If you aren't sure about a full commitment, there is the option of a 2-week 'have-a-go' starter membership (this is a one-off, and you cannot use it in a competition as a ranked diver).
              Before you join our regular training sessions, you must complete an induction during which one of our senior divers will get you set up, started, and familiar with how we train.
              Inductions are held monthly on Tuesday or Friday nights at Westminster pool (contact us for dates and details).
              <br><br>
              We have some equipment available for loan or cheap hire to help you get started.
              Club members are always happy to share advice on the best gear and are often willing to let you try on their equipment (such as fins) to help you choose what to buy. <i>(Please note that due to COVID equipment hiring/sharing options are fairly restricted!)</i>
              We recommend asking the advice of experienced divers before spending too much money!
              <br><br>
              Going forward, it’s best to have completed a freediving course. However, as this often requires travel and costs, you are welcome to start training with us before your course - it will help you develop the skills and confidence to make the course itself a breeze!
              We do expect you to complete a freediving course within your first year of training with us, and encourage members to complete a CPR first aid course.

              <br><br>
              Invitations to regular training sessions are posted on our club facebook page. Please RSVP if you are coming so that we can be sure to accommodate you.
              Training for all levels is held at Westminster Pool on Tuesday and Friday nights.
              Additional specialised training is held other times and venues for advanced members.
              SAF does not charge for pool training sessions - there is a flat $12.50 rate which goes to pool hire.

<!--              <h4>Airport Information & Public transport</h4>-->
<!--              <p>All domestic and international flights arrive and depart from Terminal 1 at Adelaide Airport, located close to the Adelaide CBD. The easiest way to get around Adelaide is to get a <a href="https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Tickets-fares/metroCARD/Getting-a-metrocard" target="_blank">metro card</a>.-->
<!--              You can buy a metro card from the airport when you arrive in Adelaide at a ticket vending machine. You are also still able to purchase single trip tickets with cash onboard buses, trains, trams. The City West campus is located in the CBD, so whilst there is paid parking available it is easier to catch public transport. </p>-->
<!--             <h4>Public Transport, Taxis, and Rideshare from the airport</h4>-->
<!--              <p> When you exit the airport, either walk straight across the plaza to the road (if someone is picking you up), or, for all other transport walk across the plaza to the left of the main carpark building - this includes buses, taxis or rideshare services. A map can be seen below <a href="files/AdelaideAirport_map.pdf" target="_blank">or downloaded here</a>.-->
<!--                <a href="images/airport.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/airport.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin:10px auto; max-height: 350px;"></a>-->
<!--                <strong>Buses:</strong> The JetExpress (J1X) bus travels without intermediate stops in both directions between the Adelaide CBD and Adelaide Airport on weekdays. This bus operates on the standard MetroCard and Metroticket. The J1, J1A (every day) and J1H (weekends only) also travel between the airport and Adelaide CBD.<br> <strong>Taxis:</strong> Taxi fares leaving the airport incur a $2 levy. A taxi from the airport to the Adelaide CBD will cost about $30, but possibly more in peak times with traffic.-->
<!--                <br> <strong>Rideshare:</strong> In our experience rideshare services are about 20% cheaper than a taxi, but this may change in peak times.</p>-->

						<p>Pool Freediving is an extremely safe sport – but only if you follow the rules! In fact, in considering regulated training or competition, there has never been a fatality in pool freediving in the entire history of the sport! The same cannot be said of more mainstream sports such as cycling, equestrian, or even cricket, however freediving is often portrayed as a high risk, extreme sport in the media. Sadly, because of freediving’s dangerous reputation, it has been banned at many pools throughout Australia and enormous efforts are continuing to be made by freediving clubs to demonstrate the safety of our sport and gain access to more pools. We care passionately about safety, not only because we care about the reputation of the sport and need pool access to train, but also because failure to follow the rules can cost lives. All members are expected to be familiar with the following safety protocols and follow them at all times. <br> <br>
              <strong> Where and when to train? </strong> <br>
              As a freediver it may be tempting to go to a public pool in your own time for a bit of practice. Even if you feel confident that what you are doing is “safe” we ask you to limit any underwater breath hold practice to club sessions or freediving courses only. Many pool lifeguards will react strongly if they see freediving done without permission and may, as a result, formally ban the sport from their pool even if nothing went wrong. Your actions could undo years of difficult negations that have been undertaken by freediving clubs to gain access to public pools across the country. It is important for the reputation of our sport that when the public see us train, it is done in an official, co-ordinated club context. If you are keen to do additional training outside of club sessions, there are lots of surface drills you can do to improve your stroke and dry statics to improve your breath hold. Just ask us how!</p>

						<p>The key to successful freediving is relaxation.
              It is impossible to relax if you don’t trust your buddies. Whenever someone dives with you, be respectful of the trust they have placed in you and know that you are responsible for their safety and vice versa.
              Communicating clearly about your dives, adjusting your training to accommodate the needs of others, checking in with your buddies with encouraging words, and asking questions if you’re unsure, all help develop a happy, safe, relaxed training atmosphere.  Feel free to ask the advice of more senior divers regarding your any aspects of your training.
<br><br>
              <strong>Formal standards and inclusion</strong> <br>
              As we are an affiliated club of the Australian Freediving Association, this also means our members must uphold the behavioural standards set by national body.
              Their Code of Conduct is available on the AFA website, and we are in the process of training local officers to provide help and advice for our club members if needed.
              A very unique aspect of freediving is that divers must be able to rely on and trust their buddies, even if they might be their direct competition!
              Because of this, even in the competitive sport, there is a strongly supportive and welcoming culture, which we  foster from the grassroots level.

              As a club, we enjoy to welcome new members and help them develop their confidence and skills as freedivers. We love seeing the sport grow and our divers succeed.
              Our members volunteer their time to coach, teach, supervise, sit on committees, and organise events – always remember that we are volunteers!
              It is our hope that as you become a more experienced diver, you will show the same interest in mentoring newcomers, volunteering for the club, and developing this beautiful sport.
              By structuring our club in this way, it means we build up a network of highly skilled divers.
              These divers can be confident not just in their own abilities but in their capacity to look after and mentor others.
              Ultimately this means we have a growing community of safe, educated freedivers who can look after each other whether in the pool or the coean. <br><br>

              <strong>Keeping skills strong</strong><br>
              To keep our skills fresh, the club safety officer will regularly ask divers to practice rescue drills as part of their training.
              This only takes about 10 min and can be a fun activity at the end of a training session.
              Rescue drills help us maintain our skills should we need to rescue a buddy and they also build confidence and trust.
