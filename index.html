          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Welcome to South Australian Freedivers (SAF)! Our club was formed in 2014 and continues to grow, welcoming
          and mentoring new members. SAF is a formally incorporated sporting club in South Australia and the state's
          Affiliated Club of the Australian Freediving Association.
          We host multiple pool training sessions each week, the occasional ocean fun dive, and an annual pool
          competition (the South Australian Freedive Pool Challenge) along with other mini competitions, social
          events, and workshops from visiting elite divers.
          We welcome divers of all levels, from complete beginner to experienced, and seek to encourage and develop
          this sport which we love.
          Many of our club members have competed at both national and international levels, but you're welcome to
          train with us whether you’re interested in competition, fitness, spearfishing, underwater photography,
          breath-hold for surf safety, or just fun diving.
          Come along to train in a safe environment, meet other enthusiasts, find buddies to dive with, and you could
          pick up some tips from national and world champions along the way!
          <br><br>
          Our club committee usually has a mix of competitive divers, administrators and freediving judges, as well as
          recreational and social divers. The 2019-2020 committee is made up of:
          <br>
          <strong>President:</strong> Jody Fisher <br>
          <strong>Secretary:</strong> Craig de Vos <br>
          <strong>Treasurer:</strong> Cath Christie <br>
          <strong>Safety Officer:</strong> Natasha Darke <br>
          <strong>AFA Liaison:</strong> Lisa Borg <br>

          <h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>
        </div>
        <p>To join us, you need to join the Australian Freediving Association (AFA) as a SA Freedivers member
          ($90/year in total, which includes a $20 SAF club member fee). The fees are discounted by 50% mid-way
          through the membership season, and the discount has been brought forward due to COVID.
          This membership provides the club and its individuals insurance (which we need to have access to pools) and
          allows the club to reinvest in its activities (e.g. to offset costs of running competitions or workshops).
          If you aren't sure about a full commitment, there is the option of a 2-week 'have-a-go' starter membership
          (this is a one-off, and you cannot use it in a competition as a ranked diver).
          Before you join our regular training sessions, you must complete an induction during which one of our senior
          divers will get you set up, started, and familiar with how we train.
          Inductions are held monthly on Tuesday or Friday nights at Westminster pool (contact us for dates and
          details).
          <br><br>
          We have some equipment available for loan or cheap hire to help you get started.
          Club members are always happy to share advice on the best gear and are often willing to let you try on their
          equipment (such as fins) to help you choose what to buy. <i>(Please note that due to COVID equipment
            hiring/sharing options are fairly restricted!)</i>
          We recommend asking the advice of experienced divers before spending too much money!
          <br><br>
          Going forward, it’s best to have completed a freediving course. However, as this often requires travel and
          costs, you are welcome to start training with us before your course - it will help you develop the skills
          and confidence to make the course itself a breeze!
          We do expect you to complete a freediving course within your first year of training with us, and encourage
          members to complete a CPR first aid course.

          <br><br>
          Invitations to regular training sessions are posted on our club facebook page. Please RSVP if you are coming
          so that we can be sure to accommodate you.
          Training for all levels is held at Westminster Pool on Tuesday and Friday nights.
          Additional specialised training is held other times and venues for advanced members.
          SAF does not charge for pool training sessions - there is a cost of $10-12.50 (depending on session) which
          goes to pool hire.

        <p>Pool Freediving is an extremely safe sport – but only if you follow the rules! In fact, in considering
          regulated training or competition, there has never been a fatality in pool freediving in the entire history of
          the sport! The same cannot be said of more mainstream sports such as cycling, equestrian, or even cricket,
          however freediving is often portrayed as a high risk, extreme sport in the media. Sadly, because of
          freediving’s dangerous reputation, it has been banned at many pools throughout Australia and enormous efforts
          are continuing to be made by freediving clubs to demonstrate the safety of our sport and gain access to more
          pools. We care passionately about safety, not only because we care about the reputation of the sport and need
          pool access to train, but also because failure to follow the rules can cost lives. All members are expected to
          be familiar with the following safety protocols and follow them at all times. <br> <br>
          <strong> Where and when to train? </strong> <br>
          As a freediver it may be tempting to go to a public pool in your own time for a bit of practice. Even if you
          feel confident that what you are doing is “safe” we ask you to limit any underwater breath hold practice to
          club sessions or freediving courses only. Many pool lifeguards will react strongly if they see freediving done
          without permission and may, as a result, formally ban the sport from their pool even if nothing went wrong.
          Your actions could undo years of difficult negations that have been undertaken by freediving clubs to gain
          access to public pools across the country. It is important for the reputation of our sport that when the
          public see us train, it is done in an official, co-ordinated club context. If you are keen to do additional
          training outside of club sessions, there are lots of surface drills you can do to improve your stroke and dry
          statics to improve your breath hold. Just ask us how!</p>

        <div class="modal-works"><span>Communication & Trust</span></div>
        <p>The key to successful freediving is relaxation.
          It is impossible to relax if you don’t trust your buddies. Whenever someone dives with you, be respectful of
          the trust they have placed in you and know that you are responsible for their safety and vice versa.
          Communicating clearly about your dives, adjusting your training to accommodate the needs of others, checking
          in with your buddies with encouraging words, and asking questions if you’re unsure, all help develop a happy,
          safe, relaxed training atmosphere. Feel free to ask the advice of more senior divers regarding your any
          aspects of your training.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Formal standards and inclusion</strong> <br>
          As we are an affiliated club of the Australian Freediving Association, this also means our members must uphold
          the behavioural standards set by national body.
          Their Code of Conduct is available on the AFA website, and we are in the process of training local officers to
          provide help and advice for our club members if needed.
          A very unique aspect of freediving is that divers must be able to rely on and trust their buddies, even if
          they might be their direct competition!
          Because of this, even in the competitive sport, there is a strongly supportive and welcoming culture, which we
          foster from the grassroots level.

        <p>
          As a club, we enjoy to welcome new members and help them develop their confidence and skills as freedivers. We
          love seeing the sport grow and our divers succeed.
          Our members volunteer their time to coach, teach, supervise, sit on committees, and organise events – always
          remember that we are volunteers!
          It is our hope that as you become a more experienced diver, you will show the same interest in mentoring
          newcomers, volunteering for the club, and developing this beautiful sport.
          By structuring our club in this way, it means we build up a network of highly skilled divers.
          These divers can be confident not just in their own abilities but in their capacity to look after and mentor
          others.
          Ultimately this means we have a growing community of safe, educated freedivers who can look after each other
          whether in the pool or the coean. <br><br>

          <strong>Keeping skills strong</strong><br>
          To keep our skills fresh, the club safety officer will regularly ask divers to practice rescue drills as part
          of their training.
          This only takes about 10 min and can be a fun activity at the end of a training session.
          Rescue drills help us maintain our skills should we need to rescue a buddy and they also build confidence and
          trust.
